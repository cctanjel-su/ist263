    <p>Hello! My name is Chloé and I am very excited to be exploring my passion for creativity. I am fascinated by the ability to transform brands into lifestyles and connecting people's lifestyles to brands. Currently, a senior at Syracuse University majoring in Psychology and minoring in Information Management and Technology, I am able to learn about people and the way they act and perceive the world around them as well as dive deep into social media and the future of technology. The combination of these educational pursuits combined with my prior internship experiences and creativity, fuel my desire to obtain a full-time position in the beauty and Communication fields.</p>
